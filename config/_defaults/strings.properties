# this file contains value pairs to replace tokens in your app
# for example,
# APP_VENDOR=Intel
# will replace all occurrences of APP_VENDOR in your app files with Intel
# files to perform replacements on are defined in replace.txt:strings.properties
# and can be overriden by final project replace.txt.
# NOTE: the following tokens are populated automatically by the build system:
# PROJECT_NAME: your app name
# PROJECT_ALIAS: your app name, lowercased
# APP_VERSION: your app version, either from arg/env of default: 1.0.0
# APP_VERSION_CODE: your app version code calculated from APP_VERSION,
# e.g. 1.0.0 -> 10000
